Singly Linked List

ADT
1. Traversal
2. Insertion
3. Deletion

Insertion
- double pointer to a function (same as pass by reference)
- beginning => one pointer enough.
- middle/end => use two pointers.

Deletion
- double pointer to a funciton
- beginning => one pointer enough.
- middle/end => use two pointers

Doubly Linked List

Insertion
- need single temp pointer as nodes can be accessed in both direcitons.

Deletion
- need two temp pointers, for middle or last element deletion.
